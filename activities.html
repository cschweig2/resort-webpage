  <h1> Turtle Resort Activities </h1>
  <p> At Turtle Resort, there is so much to do and see within walking distance. Just down the street, at Ohana Surf Shop, you can rent stand-up paddleboards, surfboards, boogie boards, or just about anything else for a water activity you can think of. There are also remarkable snorkeling and diving destinations within a 15-minute drive. Are you a coffee drinker? Well, you're in luck! 100% Kona coffee, only found on the Big Island, is produced on numerous farms that are located a stones-throw away from the resort. </p>
